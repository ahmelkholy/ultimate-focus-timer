there is a bad behavior inthe code that is when i open the focus GUI it forget the tasks i have created in another pwsh session, i want to make it permentant that mean whenever or from wherever i open the focus GUI it will always show the tasks that i have created before, and also i want to be able to add new tasks from the GUI and save them so they will be available next time i open the GUI

another thing i can increas and decrease the width of the GUI but to certian limit i want to be able to decrease the GUI width to be more smaller than the current limit by decreasing the text in it the font is decreasing ok
