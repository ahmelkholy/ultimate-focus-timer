## üîß Manual Installation

If the automatic installation doesn't work, you can set up the aliases manually:

### PowerShell Profile Method

1. Open PowerShell and check your profile location:

   ```powershell
   echo $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
   ```

2. Edit your PowerShell profile:

   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
   ```

3. Add this function to your profile:

   ```powershell
   function focus {
       param(
           [string]$Mode = "",
           [int]$Duration = 0
       )
       & "c:\Users\ahm_e\AppData\Local\focus\scripts\focus.ps1" $Mode $Duration
   }
   ```

4. Reload your profile:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
   ```

### PATH Environment Variable Method

1. Add the scripts directory to your PATH:

   ```
   c:\Users\ahm_e\AppData\Local\focus\scripts
   ```

2. You can then use:
   ```cmd
   focus.bat gui
   focus.bat quick 25
   ```

### Git Bash / WSL Method

1. Add to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

   ```bash
   alias focus='/c/Users/ahm_e/AppData/Local/focus/scripts/focus.sh'
   ```

2. Reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
