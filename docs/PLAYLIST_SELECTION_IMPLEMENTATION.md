# Playlist Selection Feature Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Enhanced MusicController (`src/music_controller.py`)
- Modified `_select_default_playlist()` method to check for user-selected playlist first
- Added support for `classical_music_selected_playlist` config option
- If a specific playlist is selected, it will be used instead of auto-selection
- Falls back to auto-selection if the selected playlist is not found

### 2. Settings Dialog Enhancement (`src/focus_gui.py`)
- Added playlist selection dropdown in the Music settings tab
- Dropdown shows "Auto (First Available)" as the first option
- Lists all available M3U playlists from the configured directory
- Saves the selected playlist to the configuration when settings are saved

### 3. Configuration Update (`config.yml`)
- Added `classical_music_selected_playlist: ''` setting
- Empty value means auto-selection (current behavior)
- Non-empty value specifies the path to the selected playlist

## How It Works

1. **Default Behavior (Auto)**: 
   - When `classical_music_selected_playlist` is empty or not set
   - Uses the first available playlist (same as before)

2. **Manual Selection**:
   - User opens Settings dialog and goes to Music tab
   - Selects a specific playlist from the dropdown
   - The selected playlist path is saved to config
   - Next time music starts, that specific playlist will be used

3. **Playlist Discovery**:
   - Scans the directory specified in `classical_music_playlist_dir`
   - Currently set to: `C:\Users\ahm_e\mpv\PlayList`
   - Finds all `.m3u` and `.m3u8` files automatically

## Available Playlists Found:
Based on the directory scan, these playlists are available:
- ClassicalMusic.m3u
- Comprehensible Russian Podcast | Learn Russian with Max.m3u  
- Lisan Arabi - Videos.m3u
- POWER SYSTEM.m3u
- Switchgear & Protection.m3u
- حديث الصباح والمساء.m3u
- مقدمة بن خلدون.m3u
- نوتة جميلة.m3u

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open Settings**: Click the "⚙️ Settings" button in the GUI
2. **Go to Music Tab**: Click on the "Music" tab in the settings dialog
3. **Select Playlist**: Use the "Select Playlist" dropdown to choose your preferred playlist
4. **Save Settings**: Click "Save" to apply the changes
5. **Start Music**: The selected playlist will be used when music starts

## Minimal Code Changes

The implementation required minimal changes to the existing codebase:
- Only modified the playlist selection logic in MusicController
- Added a single dropdown control to the existing Settings dialog
- Added one new configuration option
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

This provides the exact functionality requested: the ability to choose which M3U playlist to play from the folder containing multiple playlists, with minimal changes to the codebase.
